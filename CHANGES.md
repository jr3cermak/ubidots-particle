Moved this port to another repo.  Will reference it later.

We are able to build and begin testing [44244]

i/o wiring complete, now to do the actual send/recv parts. [52788]

BYTE ORDER CODE:

https://developer.mbed.org/users/vshymanskyy/code/Blynk/docs/b942afadf9be/BlynkProtocolDefs_8h_source.html

https://fossies.org/linux/misc/mosh-1.3.0.tar.gz/mosh-1.3.0/src/crypto/byteorder.h?m=t

Next: wire up the i/o functions [52596]

do_clnt_handshake() [52516]

* process_server_hello()
  * ssl_session_update() [50340] 
* send_client_key_xchg()
  * DISPLAY_RSA() -> RSA_print() -> putc in bigint.ccp (TODO FIX) [51252]

Next area: do_clnt_handshake() and do_srv_handshake().   Firmware size: 49780

TODO: Add ability to disable SERVER code.

Next area: do_handshake().   Firmware size: 49716

Slowly getting the connection established with axtls.

I/O symbols Traced to basic_read().  Firmware size: 46580.

Now to define the ssl_read and ssl_write functions so it
does not use standard I/O.

Avoid C language references to:

* printf
* time
* gettimeofday

We need proper c++ libraries for byte shifting.

x509_crt.cpp: There is directory access that is deliberately commented out which might
  be contributing to Ubidots failure.

We are going to start with the development tree from the mbedtls
Github site and see if this fixes a few bugs and allows us to
connect with the https://things.ubidots.com site.

We are developing a bash script that will do a mass conversion of
source code so we can eliminate a lot of typing.

* Conversion going fairly well.  Strict compiler errors require
some standard casting to be added to some source code.

* There are a lot of missing casts for (void *)

## config.h

Playing with config.h broke its communication with other sites!  Restored config.h
and I can talk to other sites now.

## No longer talks to my original site

* jupyter fails with -28928 = -0x7100 : MBEDTLS_ERR_SSL_BAD_INPUT_DATA
* -26880 = -0x6900 : MBEDTLS_ERR_SSL_WANT_READ

## Getting closer

* We know it dies in the handShake() and the connection is not live

```
0000008243 [app] INFO: begin connect()

* What is error -16?

## Take 2

Firmware size getting large!
```
downloading binary from: /v1/binaries/59418143b34e65370745f363

```

This is what we need:

* RSA with Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie Hellman (ECDHE-RSA) key exchange
* mbed TLS Name / NIST Name: TLS-ECDHE-RSA-WITH-AES-256-GCM-SHA384
* OpenSSL equivalent: ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
* Value: {0xC0,0x30}

## Current problem

The TlsTcpClient program dies with this error in the SSL validation.   Why does this fail but
curl continue to work?

* 0000009880 [app] INFO: Connect res = -30592
* http://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-hex.htm
* -30592 -> -0x7780
* MBEDTLS_ERR_SSL_FATAL_ALERT_MESSAGE via ssl.h
* Possible solution?
* https://tls.mbed.org/discussions/platform-specific/shakehand-failed-and-return-mbedtls_err_ssl_fatal_alert_message
* We have to enable more cypher suites!
* config.h
* #define MBEDTLS_KEY_EXCHANGE_ECDHE_RSA_ENABLED
* Requires: MBEDTLS_ECDH_C, MBEDTLS_RSA_C, MBEDTLS_PKCS1_V15, MBEDTLS_X509_CRT_PARSE_C

## Starting out

* The TlsTcpClient works for other SSL websites, it seems the Ubidots server is
using a self-signed certificate that breaks the client.
* There is a lot of code to support SSL and bloats the final firmware binary.  If you
are consistently using a particular server, then we can tune the software to only use the
parts of encryption we really need.   The downside to this is when the certificate or
encryption change, then you have to re-send your firmware to the devices that need it.
* Now to the breakage!
* https://things.ubidots.com:443 uses the following encryption
* TLS 1.2 connection using TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
* It offers the following certificates
* Server certificate: things.ubidots.com
* Server certificate: Lets Encrypt Authority X3
* Server certificate: DST Root CA X3
* You can discover all this using curl -v https://things.ubidots.com/
* We should write a program that tells the user which parts of the code
* There is something we can do later that may allow us to dynamically pull in the
encryption chunks as we need them. [dynamic libraries](https://community.particle.io/t/dynamic-linking/30593)


# 2017-06-13

## Working towards 3.0.0

* Fix more spelling mistakes
* Define a structure based on the Value structure.
* Start building the getDevices() routine.
* Version bump 3.0.0 as we switch things from an apparently depricated API
to the currently documented http/https REST API.

### TODO

* See if we can add to a dummy variable the old way
* See if we can add to a dummy variable the new way
* See if we can retrieve data in a date range
* Compare to data we have and send un-sent data

## General clean up and experimentation

* Not much documentation on the translate.ubidots.com API, so
we will begin to phase that out.   
* Allow switching between http and https modes and allow selecting of
a different port number.
* Fix some typos
* Spark.process() -> Particle.process();
* Eliminate all compile warnings

These warnings can not be fixed with simple updates.   These will be
rewritten and we will just bump the version to 3.X.X.
